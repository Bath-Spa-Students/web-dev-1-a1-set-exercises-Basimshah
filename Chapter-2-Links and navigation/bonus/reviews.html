        <p>Stella Nicholls, an outcast girl from Mill Valley, Pennsylvania, is an aspiring writer with just two friends: Auggie Hilderbrandt and Chuck Steinberg. On Halloween night, the three friends decide to perpetrate a prank on the bully Tommy Milner by fleeing to a drive-in movie, where the stranger Ram√≥n Morales hides and defends the teens. They decide to spend the night visiting the haunted house of the Bellows family, where Stella uncovers the book of stories of the renowned Sarah Bellows. She gets the book home and quickly finds that Sarah is writing one horror story per day with each of them, so she attempts to figure out how to stop Sarah.</p>
