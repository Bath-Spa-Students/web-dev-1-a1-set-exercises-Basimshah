                <td><p>To make this simple delicious dish from scratch, begin by preparing the chenna at home. Heat 1 1/2 liters of milk in a deep-bottomed pot over a high temperature. Once the milk begins to boil, turn off the heat. Combine water and lemon juice and stir into the boiling milk. Once the milk begins to crumble, strain off the excess water using a muslin cloth and securely knot the crumbled milk extracts in the towel. Set it aside for 15-20 minutes.</p></td>
                <td><p>Rub the chhena until it is soft, like white butter, and may be made into a dough. Once finished, shape the dough into balls and press them lightly. Repeat this method until the dough is done. Cover them with a moist towel and then make the sugar syrup. Place a kadhai over medium heat and add 2 cups sugar and 1 1/2 litres of boiling water. Simply boil the water until the sugar syrup is ready; then, add the rasmalai and cook for 5 minutes. The rasmalais will turn double, indicating that you should switch off the flame.</p></td>
                <td><p>Take a deep-bottomed pan and heat the remaining milk in it. When the milk begins to boil, add the saffron, along with the chopped pistachios and almonds. Allow this milk mixture to become a somewhat thick consistency for 5-7 minutes. Now, add 1 cup of sugar and stir thoroughly. When the milk blend has been reduced by half, turn off the heat and transfer to a bowl.</p></td>
                <td><p>Pour the sugar syrup into a dish filled with ice cubes. Add the rasmalai to the hot-cold sugar syrup one by one. Keep them in for 2 minutes, then wring off the excess water and pour the rasmalai in saffron milk. Let the rasmalai soak for 3-4 hours to absorb the milk's creamy texture. It tastes finest when cold!</p></td>
